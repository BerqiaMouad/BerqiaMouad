# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mouad Berqia

I'm Mouad from Morocco, and I'm Computer Science student and part time Frotn-end web developer. I really enjoy learning new things related to tech and computer science and I am also interested in machine learning. I also do some competitive programming, in fact I have participated in many contests and won some of them. I really love to work on new projects with new people.
